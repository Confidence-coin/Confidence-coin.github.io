# Confidence Coin

There are two types of currencies in the world, centralized and decentralized: Black and white.

Confidence coin is the new color. 
It takes the idea of locally centralized trusted parties and binds them under a decentralized umbrella, creating something new. 
It's called Decentralized Trusted Party(DTP).

How does it work?

DTP is a third party that controls users' wallets and performs transactions on their behalf, everyone can start a DTP, but It is expected that DTP will be a legal company in the US.

The idea is that DTP will perform off-chain transactions and later commit them to the blockchain. The Confidence Coin algorithm enforces DTP to perform a periodic update transaction to update the balance of all its users. It is done in a very efficient way. To update the balance of 1,000,000 users, the transaction will only require 3.8 to 11.4 MB. 

DTP doesn't have access to users` private keys. Users use the blockchain protocol to give DTP control over their wallet, and they can revoke it in the same way. More details in white papers describe how Confidence Coin solves the race condition problems between off-chain and blockchain transactions. For now, let me tell you more about what DTP can do.

The DTP can move coins from wallets in the DTP group(Owned by users who authorized DTP to control their wallets) to external wallets. It is done via a regular transaction over a blockchain. 

The DTP can create new wallets, but it still doesn't get access to wallets' private keys. A user needs to generate a public and private key and share the public key with the DTP. The DTP will then be able to send coins to the new public key, and a new wallet will be created in the system and automatically added to the DTP group.

Here are a few examples to demonstrate how this all may look like
## DTP Examples
### Target® DTP
Target® creates DTP and offer zero fee and instant transactions. 
Customers use the blockchain to join the Target® DTP group. 

Target® is happy because it spends less money on Confidence Coin transaction fees and DTP server costs compared to the fees it pays for the credit card companies.
Target® DTP group customers are happy because they get more promotions and enjoy the same purchase experience as with Google or Apple Pay.
### CoinBase® DTP
CoinBase® creates DTP and offers to purchase and trade Confidence Coin on its platform.

CoinBase® is happy because it has less responsibility for protecting user coins. Most of the protection comes directly from the Confidence Coin algorithm.
Users are happy because they don't need CoinBase® permission to extract their coins from CoinBase®.

## Confidence Coin Adoption
It's easy to see DTP benefits for the users and DTP owners. But there is a benefit for the entire system.
Transactions become more controllable by making most transactions run off the chain. Government can better protect Confidence Coin users from fraudulent activity and Money laundering. It's also a strong argument for the government to accept this coin.

Off-chain transactions also offer more privacy for users since those transactions are not publicly broadcast.
