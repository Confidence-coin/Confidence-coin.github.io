The Confidence Coin blockchain is a unique and innovative platform that offers its holders a unique reward system. The block reward is split equally between the validators and the holders, ensuring that everyone who contributes to the network is fairly compensated.

## Becoming a Holder
To become a holder on the Confidence Coin blockchain, coins must be put on hold for a period of 1-120 months. The number of coins held is used as the baseline for calculating rewards.

## Incentives for Holding
Holders are incentivized to keep their coins on hold for longer periods by multiplying the baseline by 1.016 for each additional month of holding. This means that the longer the coins are held, the higher the rewards will be. This disincentivizes selling and drives up demand for the coin.

## Zero Rewards for Last Day Holding
To encourage holders to continually add more coins to their holding, the Confidence Coin blockchain implements a linear penalty that decreases rewards each day. As a result, holders will receive zero rewards on the last day of holding. It makes the game more interesting and equal and drives more people to hold.

In conclusion, the Confidence Coin blockchain is a revolutionary platform that empowers its holders with a unique reward system. By splitting the block reward equally between the validators and the holders, and by incentivizing long-term holding and adding value to the network, the Confidence Coin blockchain is poised to become one of the most innovative and successful blockchain platforms in the world.
