 - In today's crypto privacy is achieved through anonymity, it creates an environment where criminals can exploit the system and commit fraudulent activities. 
   - It makes it difficult for individuals and businesses to trust the currency and those who use it
 - Transaction processing times are slow and fees are high, making it inefficient and costly for users to make transactions
