## The Solution
Confidence Coin addresses other cryptocurrencies challenges in two ways: 
- All the transactions must be made via a Decentralized Trusted Party (DTP). It aggregates off-chain transactions of its members and provides only the final balance updates to the blockchain. It is hiding any other transaction details from the public eye. 
   - Each business has its own DTP, and DTPs are legal companies, ensuring trust in the transactions made via Confidence Coin.
- Confidence Coin uses an evolution of the Proof of Stake (PoS), the Flash algorithm. With Flash, validators share transactions and votes via a new block that each validator creates, allowing for one-step, parallel consensus. Flash can process over a million balance updates in each block, making transactions ridiculously fast. 

With the combination of DTP and Flash, Confidence Coin offers clean privacy and fast transactions.
