## Solution
Confidence Coin is the solution to these challenges. It is powered by the Flash Consensus Mechanism, which optimizes the network transaction cycle into a single step of sharing a block. This dramatically shortens and simplifies the transaction cycle, making it faster and more secure.

Confidence Coin also uses the Decentralized Trusted Party (DTP), which aggregates all transactions of its members and only provides balance updates. This ensures high-speed and high-privacy transactions, as it does not reveal the transaction origin, destination, or the amount involved.
