# Confidence Coin Whitepaper
*v 0.1 - Don't read it before v 1.0 :)*


I am going to write it more as a spec rather then the whitepaper. And not even a spec, but more as a recepy to bake Coco.
Don't expect for more then that for 0.1 :)

There will be two types of nodes in Coco network. A wallet and a verifier.

## Wallets 
 - Manage user private keys
 - Create new transactions
 - Share blocks
 
## Verifiers
 - Share blocks
 - Create new blocks

# Sharing Blocks

There will be a tool like BitTorrent that Verifiers will use to share blocks.
Wallets will contribute for sharing by being a peer.
